Recap: What's an agentic workflow?
An agentic workflow is a flow that involves an agent at some point,
typically to handle decision making or answer synthesis.
                                          Agent
               Processing                                 Processing
 Input              or                    LLM                  or         Output
               Data Lookup                                Data Lookup
                                   Tool         Tool



In agent-framework, a workflow is a graph with Executor nodes and edges between:

               Executor     edge    Executor           edge   Executor
   Input                                                                 Output

Only one executor runs at a given time.   and outputs are aggregated.
```

## Slide 8

![Slide 8](slide_images/slide_8.png)

```
Anatomy of a concurrent workflow
This is a common topology, where inputs fan-out and outputs fan-in to aggregator:

                                                     aggregator
                            Executor
    Input                                             Executor         Output
                            Executor


 Also possible:
 • workflows with dynamic fan-out (optional executors)
 • workflows without an explicit aggregator
```

## Slide 9

Using fan-in/fan-out edges in workflows



Use WorkflowBuilder with add_fan_out_edges and add_fan_in_edges:
 workflow = (WorkflowBuilder(
       name="FanOutFanInEdges",
       description="Explicit fan-out/fan-in using edge groups.",
       start_executor=dispatcher,
     output_executors=[aggregator])
    .add_fan_out_edges(dispatcher, [researcher, marketer, legal])
    .add_fan_in_edges([researcher, marketer, legal], aggregator)
    .build())

Aggregation patterns for fan-in agents

                                                                                                    Final
      Input                                                              Aggregator
                                                                                                   output
                                      Agent B

Pattern               Aggregator implementation            Final output     When to use?
Concatenation         String operations or template        Formatted str You control the layout exactly

Output synthesis      LLM call to summarize outputs        Natural prose You want a human-readable summary

Majority vote         Count most common output label       Winner label     Multiple judges classify same input

                                                           Pydantic
Structured extraction LLM call with structured outputs                      Downstream code needs typed data
                                                           model
Score & rank          LLM-as-a-judge call to score outputs Ranked list      Generate N options, pick the best

Using the built-in ConcurrentBuilder workflow
from agent_framework.orchestrations import ConcurrentBuilder

workflow = ConcurrentBuilder(
            participants=[researcher, marketer, legal]).build()




The workflow assumes that participants accept and emit conversation-shaped data,
so executors must be Agents or custom Executors that process conversations.
The extra start/end nodes normalize input and output to list[Message].

Specialist agents
                    places to visit.
                    - language_agent: A helpful assistant that can provide language tips
                    for a given destination.
                    - travel_summary_agent: A helpful assistant that can summarize the
                    travel plan.
                    Based on the team composition, and known and unknown facts, please
                    devise a short bullet-point plan for addressing the original request.

Using the built-in MagenticBuilder workflow
     orchestrator
                                        The MagenticOrchestrator node
                                        contains a StandardMagenticManager,
                                        which wraps the provided manager_agent,
                                        and plans and delegates tasks.


magentic_workflow = MagenticBuilder(
  participants=[local_agent, language_agent, travel_summary_agent],
  manager_agent=manager_agent,
  max_round_count=10,
  max_stall_count=1,
  max_reset_count=1,
  ).build()

From fixed graphs to dynamic routing
 FIXED GRAPH                                               DYNAMIC ROUTING
 Developer defines edges. LLM picks a path.                Agents decide the next step at runtime.

                                      edge(B, C)
                                                                                   agent decides
                                                                                                           B
                edge(A, B)   B                     C
       A                                                         A                     ?                   C
               edge(A, D)    D
                                                                                                           D

 • All edges declared at build time                        • No predefined edges between agents
 • LLM selects which branch, not which agent               • Routing emerges from conversation state
 • Topology is static — predictable and testable           • Topology is dynamic — flexible and adaptive

Handoff orchestration
                                                      The start agent just
                                                      kicks off the flow.
                                       Agent B
    start agent
                                                      Any agent can hand off
                                                      control to any other
     Agent A                       handoff            agent at runtime.

                                       Agent C        The receiving agent fully
                                                      owns the conversation
                                                      until it hands back.

 No edges are defined up front – routing emerges from conversation state.

   start agent                             handoff orchestration can
                                           handoff to every other agent.
                                           In autonomous mode, they will
                                           never ask the user for input.

                              handoff

     Control Active agent transfers control to another   Supervisor calls sub-agent tools,
       Flow agent (peer-to-peer).                        control returns to supervisor.
       Task Ownership moves to receiving agent.          Supervisor retains ownership end-to-end.
  Ownership
    Context Conversation context is handed over.         Supervisor selects what context each tool gets.
